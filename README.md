PART 1 [15%]
Design an ontology based on the following sentences:
·   Accidents can be categorised as chemical, electrical, fire, kinetic or liquid.
·   An accident can only be one of the above types.
·   An investigation is conducted for accidents.
·   An investigation only covers one accident.
·   Accidents can cause different types of injuries or damage, relating to the type of accident.
·   A person may be involved with an accident as a victim, witness, or investigator. But an investigator cannot be a witness or victim because they may suffer from a conflict of interests.
·   An object may be damaged by an accident. A person who owns an object that is damaged is a victim.
·   A victim can be injured.
·   An investigation can either be In Progress or Complete.
·   An investigation can be conducted by only 1 investigator.
·   Zach is conducting an investigation for a workshop fire.
·   The workshop fire damaged a motor generator that cost $2000.
·   The workshop fire caused a total of $15,000 damage.
·   Accident Damage has 3 levels, low up to $1000, and high is anything over $10,000.
·   Tom works at the workshop and got burnt on his legs during the fire.
·   George is investigating the accident where Charlie slipped over in a laboratory.
·   Charlie smashed a sensor valued at $800 when he slipped and also hurt his head.
·   Allyssa is an electrician and she often investigates electrical accidents.  
·   Allyssa is investigating two accidents for the same air-compressor. The 1st accident occurred when Sam plugged in the air compressor (while it was switched on) which shorted out the computer and scales on the same circuit, doing $2000 damage to the computer and $500 damage to the scales. The 2nd accident occurred when Hubert used the switch to turn the compressor on and received a minor shock.Complete the ontology by adding inverse, symmetric, and transitive properties and appropriate property, instance and class restrictions to achieve correct inference.
